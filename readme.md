### An event to test the most important skill of a hacker: **Searching on Stack Overflow**

## What is this event?

We all have been stuck with a bug or error in the past at some point. The best friend of a coder in this scenario is the Stack Overflow.
The one stop place to find answers to all your questions but finding the correct answer is a skill that needs to be honed.

This event aims to test that very skill.
You will be given a list of bugs and errors from across the spectrum and you have to find the most appropriate Stack Overflow Discussion that fixes a bug or error from that list.
